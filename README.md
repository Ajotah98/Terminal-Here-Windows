## Notes

This registry file adds the necessary entries to the Windows registry to enable the "PowerShell Here" and "CMD Here" options in the context menu. The options are added to the "Directory\Background\shell" key, which means they will appear when you right-click on a folder or the desktop.

Adding this functionality to your context menu can improve your workflow and save you time. However, please note that modifying the Windows registry can be dangerous if not done correctly. Always ensure that you backup your registry before making any changes.

Enjoy your newfound command prompt options!
